An unarmed prisoner is escaping! Quick, slice their limbs off with a plasmasword!    
    
I'm sure we all wish we could simply order colonists to punch without unequipping them (or can't even unequip if they have implanted weapons). So here's a punch button!

This simply uses the same code used for social fighting, so it should be compatible with anything.

Primary Changes
Adds a punch attack button that appears while colonists are drafted, which functions the same as melee attack, but uses only unarmed attacks (won't use implant weapons either!)

*Near 0% performance impact (0.001ms per selected pawn when button needs to be rendered).
*Safe to add mid-game.
*Safe to remove mid-game, but make sure no colonists are in the middle of a punch attack job.
*Confirmed compatible with CE, Vanilla Expanded series, Alpha series, and Humanoid Alien Races.
*No other known incompatibilies.

(Steam workshop can be slow/janky at detecting updated mods. If the mod doesn't update, unsubscribe, wait a few seconds, and resubscribe to force it to download the latest files)
~2.0 update: Now compatible with 1.4!
